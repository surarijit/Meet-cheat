In this era of online classes, it's very difficult to keep track of the links (of google meet) and the time when it's going to get started. 
You would have to keep your whatsapp (or other forms of messenger/email clients) open to check if the meeting link has arrived. I have automated the entire process using python so that one can join the meeting as soon as the host provides the link.
