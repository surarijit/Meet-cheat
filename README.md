In this era of online classes, it's very difficult to keep track of the links (of online meets) and the time when it's going to get started. 
You would also have to keep your whatsapp (or other forms of messenger/email-clients) open to check if the meeting link has arrived. I have automated this entire process using python so that one can join the meeting as soon as the host provides the link automatically without user intervention. This would save your time and energy for you last minute preparations.
